# Easy Community BOT
 This is a simple bot created for small communities, it has the main commands, for example !ban, !kick etc.


## How to download?

You can download the bot simply by downloading a releases or clone the bot on your computer via git or github desktop, I recommend that you always download the latest release to prevent any problems.
## How to configure?

To configure the bot, just edit the lines in the config, in each line you will find what you have to put, for example in the **staffRole** entry there must be a role that all staff members will then have.

config.json 

    {
    "token": "insert the bot token",
    "prefix": "!", 
    "staffRole": "insert the id",
    "moderationAlertChannel": "insert the id",
    "guild": "insert the id"
    }
